Some scripts...



`search.sh` finds the sum of the files in a directory. Specifically, for checking whether the number of labels produced matches the number of images present.

* for `training_data/`: 6322 images
* for `test_data/`: 396 images
* for `valiation_data/`: 581 images

`excheck.sh` finds if there are any non-jpeg or non-jpg files present in the directories. Seemed like I had some strays.
